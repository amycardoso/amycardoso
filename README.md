i'm a developer based in brazil. my day job is backend (java, spring) and
some ai/ml engineering. i also lead a team — stressful but cool, two sides
of the same coin. but the stuff i'm most excited about right now is creative
coding — experiments, building whatever comes to mind, expression.

i built statusbeat to sync spotify to slack status because i wanted my
team to see what i was listening to. i keep some expression experiments
at my creative coding gallery.

i'm learning piano, i read a lot, and i like being outside.

the best code i write is the code nobody asked for.
